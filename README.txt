Documentation for Converter.exe:

This program converts raw data from a DIY IR-camera to a grayscale-image.

Try pulling testfile.txt over Converter.exe for a testrun!


The rawdatafile must be ordered like this:
First one line with one number, x, which is the width of the array. (Number of columns.)
Then another line with one number, y, which is the height of the array. (Number of rows.)

Then follows y lines, x numbers one each line, in this format:
One number of four (4) ciphers, or m number of spaces and 4-m ciphers.
Then a space before a new number of four (4) ciphers.

This program is not restricted to matrixes in quadratic form. Maximum sizes for datafiles are not known as of 08.06.2012.
For comparison, testfile.txt and the file generated by Converter.exe, testfile.txt.bmp are attached.

An example file may look like this:
